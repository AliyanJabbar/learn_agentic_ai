### The **temperature** parameter controls how creative or deterministic the model is.

### -> A higher value (e.g., 0.8–1.0) makes responses more diverse and creative.

### -> A lower value (e.g., 0.0–0.3) makes responses more focused and deterministic.

### max_tokens only limits the length of the output—it doesn’t affect creativity.
